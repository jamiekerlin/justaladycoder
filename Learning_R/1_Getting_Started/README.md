# Getting Started in R

## What is R?
R is a programming language and free and open-source software.  
[Learn more about R here](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)

## Why should I use R?
 * Statistics: R has powerful and extensive packages for conducting complex statistical analyses
 * Visualizations: *ggplot* and other packages lend to the ability to create beautiful visualizations in R
 * Data cleaning: packages like *tidyverse* create an intuitive way to clean data
 * Data mining: packages like *rvest* have simplified data mining processes

## Installing R and RStudio
R is the coding program/language while R Studio is the interface. You need to install R before you install RStudio.
 1. Download R first: https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/
  * You want to download R from the closest CRAN mirror (for example, Oregon State University CRAN is the closest to Los Angeles, CA)
  * From Google: “CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R. Please use the CRAN mirror nearest to you to minimize network load.”

 2.	Download RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
  * Do this after you’ve installed R

## Navigating the RStudio interface
Using R is easy with the RStudio interface. Stay tuned for a video walking through navigating the interface but for now, use this cheatsheet to help get accustomed to the interface.  
[RStudio Interface CheatSheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rstudio-ide.html?_gl=1*1ny91dd*_ga*MTA4NjU1NjYwMi4xNjkwMzMyNTE3*_ga_2C0WZ1JHG0*MTcyODE0ODE1OS4zLjAuMTcyODE0ODE1OS4wLjAuMA..)

## Understanding the rules of using R
While we will share code and explain what each line of code does, it is important for you to understand the basic rules of coding in R. R is a literal language and code must be written as we show to work! (Yes, that includes spaces, case-sensitivity, etc.) A good resource you can start with if you're having trouble is [this section of Learning Statistics with R.](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/introR.html#firstcommand)

## Scripts, Markdown, Shiny, More
There are many ways you can write your code within R. Some examples we'll go over will be R Scripts, [R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rmarkdown.html?_gl=1*d9fzsh*_ga*MTA4NjU1NjYwMi4xNjkwMzMyNTE3*_ga_2C0WZ1JHG0*MTcyODE0ODE1OS4zLjEuMTcyODE0OTMxNS4wLjAuMA..), and [R Shiny](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/shiny.html?_gl=1*d9fzsh*_ga*MTA4NjU1NjYwMi4xNjkwMzMyNTE3*_ga_2C0WZ1JHG0*MTcyODE0ODE1OS4zLjEuMTcyODE0OTMxNS4wLjAuMA..). Find the methods that work for the purpose of the project you are working on or use whichever speaks to you the most!

## Other great resources to start with
Some helpful resources to get you started:  
 * [R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)
 * [Posit Cheat Sheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)
 * [The Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

## Next steps
Now that you've set up your R, let's move on to the next section, [Data Cleaning in R](https://github.com/jamiekerlin/justaladycoder/tree/main/Learning_R/2_Data_Cleaning). Here, you'll learn how to import your data and get it ready to analyze.
