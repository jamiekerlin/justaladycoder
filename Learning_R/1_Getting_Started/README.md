# Getting Started in R

## What is R?

## Why should I use R?

## Installing R and RStudio
R is the coding program/language while R Studio is the interface. You need to install R before you install RStudio.
1. Download R first: https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/
  * You want to download R from the closest CRAN mirror (for example, Oregon State University CRAN is the closest to Los Angeles, CA)
  * From Google: “CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R. Please use the CRAN mirror nearest to you to minimize network load.”

2)	Download RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
-	Do this after you’ve installed R
