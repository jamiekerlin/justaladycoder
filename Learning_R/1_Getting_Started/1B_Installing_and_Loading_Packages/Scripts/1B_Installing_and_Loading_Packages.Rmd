# Introduction
R works by running functions that live within packages. To use these packages, we must install them and load them whenever we open or restart R. Here, I will show how to install/load packages and have you install 3 of my favorite packages. 

## Installing Packages
We need to install packages before we can use them. I will use the *tidyverse* package as an example (it's my favorite package). To install packages you will run this code (by removing the hashtag in front of the "install.packages" function).

```{r}

# install.packages("tidyverse") 
# function is "install.packages"
# argument is "tidyverse" AKA the name of the package in quotation marks

```

Packages only need to be installed once, so after installing code, you want to comment out the code by placing a hashtag in front of the code. This stops the line of code from running.

You can also include a conditional install in your code so that you do not have to comment out your code.
This code does the following:  
  * Creates a list of the packages that will be used in the script  
  * For each of the packages in the script, it searches for the name of the package in the list of the installed packages  
  * If the package does not exist in the list, it installs it, otherwise it does nothing

```{r}

requiredPackages = c('tidyverse', 'here', 'janitor') #create a list of the packages to conditionall install

for(p in requiredPackages){ # for each of the packages (we'll call this "p") in the list above (requiredPackages), do the following:
  
  if(!require(p,character.only = TRUE)) install.packages(p) # if the package is not in the list of installed packages, install the package, or else do not install the package
}

```


## Loading libraries

To load libraries, run the following code:

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

# library() is the function
# tidyverse is the argument AKA the name of the package. It does not need to be in quotations because it is already installed in the packages

```

We do not need to comment out the lines that load the libraries/packages because they need to be ran everytime R is restarted.

We can now add on to our conditional install code from above, telling it to then load all packages.


```{r}

requiredPackages = c('tidyverse', 'here', 'janitor') #create a list of the packages to conditionall install

for(p in requiredPackages){ # for each of the packages (we'll call this "p") in the list above (requiredPackages), do the following:
  
  if(!require(p,character.only = TRUE)) install.packages(p) # if the package is not in the list of installed packages, install the package, or else do not install the package

  library(p,character.only = TRUE) # we add this line of code and it loads all the packages
  
}
```

Please run the conditional install code above in your own R to install my favorite packages that we will be using, *tidyverse*, *here*, and *janitor*.
